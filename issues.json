    "body": "After reading through the current draft, I'd like to bring to your attention the concept of Bitcoin Vaults, which hasn't received much focus so far but that I believe might be interesting to discuss in this scenario, as it could add some value to this draft.\r\n\r\n## Concept\r\nInstead of using standard multisigs or P2KH to store the coins under custody, a more complex script can be used to deters attackers and/or establish withdrawal protocols enforced by the Bitcoin consensus.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\nAs far as I know the idea of Bitcoin Vaults was originally proposed on the [Bitcoin covenants paper](https://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/MES16.pdf) but that proposal required a soft-fork to work, so it's not really interesting.\r\n\r\nA few years later, Bryan Bishop proposed another scheme on the [bitcoin-dev mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-August/017229.html) that takes the original idea and makes it's implementation viable in the current Bitcoin chain, turning it into something much more interesting for custodians.\r\n\r\n## Bitcoin Vaults\r\nEssentially, the scheme describes a system where withdrawal of funds is delayed and during that delay it's possible to send the coins back to the vault, thus if the keys ever get stolen, the original owner can just lock them forever. The idea is that, by introducing the possibility of denying the attacker their reward, attackers will be less likely to target the system.\r\n\r\n### Expanded vaults\r\nUsing the same primitives, covenants and relative timelocks, it is possible to construct the following schemes:\r\n- Arbitrary hierarchy of keys: At the bottom you'd have weakly-secured keys that can withdraw the money really slowly, and as you go up in the hierarchy the keys get more strongly secured and have more power (can revoke transactions issued by lower keys).\r\n- Staged partial withdrawals: Make it possible for weakly-secured keys to only withdraw small amounts (eg: 1% per day) while strongly-secured keys can withdraw more money. This is interesting because current custodian solutions need to use their keys every time there is a movement of funds to a hot wallet, therefore putting the whole cold wallet at risk, while with staged withdrawals you could just use the lower-level keys for that and if they get stolen an attacker would only be able to steal part of the funds. This may also be able to remove the need to have hot wallets.\r\n\r\n## Drawbacks\r\nThe main problem I can see with this approach is that the script used for these vaults will need to be revealed to the world, and given that it is a non-standard script, that will leak data on the owner of the coins locked there. Note that this has already happened in the past with non-standard multisig scripts, see the section on `Real life example - Rare multisignature scripts` in [the Privacy page of the bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy). I don't really know how  if this is a problem at all for this usecase, but it might be possible to solve it by using P2SH-encumbered transaction trees and ECDSA MPC (Multi Party Computation) schemes.\r\n\r\n## Other blockchains\r\nThe design proposed here can be also easily implemented in any chain that supports smart contracts, such as Ethereum, where smart-contract-based wallets are starting to become the norm and could actually be used to build much more complex mechanisms than the ones described here.\r\n\r\nAs of 21/2/2021, a back-of-the-envelope sum of the market cap of the biggest currencies that could support vaults (btc, eth, bch, bsv, ltc, eos) accounts for 80% of the global cryptocurrency market cap."
